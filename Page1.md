# Creating the new POD from the running POD
The use case is to create new POD from the running POD. The running POD is waiting for topic(Message Broker) which should able to create new POD based on the Topic Type.

If the Topic is "Topic1", then it should invoke the POD1 and If the "Topic2" then create POD2. Based on the run time condition, running POD should able to spawn new PODs.
